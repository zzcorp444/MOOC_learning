                I learned a lot on my own
                in IT, financial products and its markets, how to set up small
                business. Thus, thanks to many
                traveling, having lived in a foreign country, having done several missions
                humanitarian organizations in very disadvantaged countries I have developed a keen sense of adaptability,
                teamwork which makes me a committed, creative, open-minded, curious person
                who learns quickly and reliably at work.
